## üìò Campaign Automation Tutorial

Follow this tutorial to automate the campaign trigger system using n8n and the Evolution API alongside ChatWoot.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have installed:

- ChatWoot
- n8n
- Evolution API
- pgAdmin or your preferred PostgreSQL database management tool

### Step 1: Create an SMS Channel Inbox for Bandwidth

1. **Access ChatWoot**: Log in to your ChatWoot account.
2. **Settings**: Go to the settings section.
3. **Inboxes**: Select "Inboxes" from the menu.
4. **Add New Inbox**: Click on the "Add New Inbox" button.
5. **Select Channel Type**: Choose "SMS" and select "Bandwidth" as the channel type.
6. **Configure Channel Details**:
   - Inbox Name: Trigger (or your preferred name).
   - Phone Number: +741963
   - Account ID: 741963
   - Application ID: 741963
   - API Key: 741963
   - API Secret Key: 741963
7. **Save Settings**: Click "Create Bandwidth Channel" to create the new inbox.

### Step 2: Add Columns to the ChatWoot Database

1. **Access the Database**: Use pgAdmin or your preferred tool to access the ChatWoot database.
2. **Add Column to Accounts Table**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE accounts
   ADD COLUMN limite_disparo INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 100;
   ```
3. **Add Columns to Campaigns Table**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE campaigns
   ADD COLUMN status_envia INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

   ALTER TABLE campaigns
   ADD COLUMN enviou INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

   ALTER TABLE campaigns
   ADD COLUMN falhou INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
   ```
4. **Create Table for Failed Sends**:
   ```sql
   CREATE SEQUENCE campaigns_failed_id_seq;

   CREATE TABLE campaigns_failed (
       id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('campaigns_failed_id_seq'::regclass),
       contact_name TEXT NOT NULL,
       phone VARCHAR NOT NULL,
       campaign_id INTEGER NOT NULL
   );
   ```

## Mandatory Database Fixes

### Correct Labels Table

- Identified mismatches between the "labels" and "tags" tables.
- Apply the following functions and triggers to synchronize these tables:

**Replication Function:**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION replicate_labels_to_tags()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO tags (id, name)
    VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.title);
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**Deletion Function:**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION delete_labels_from_tags_and_taggings()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM tags WHERE id = OLD.id;
    DELETE FROM taggings WHERE tag_id = OLD.id;
    RETURN OLD;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**Update Function:**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_labels_to_tags()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    UPDATE tags
    SET name = NEW.title
    WHERE id = NEW.id;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**Triggers:**

- Insert:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER after_insert_labels
AFTER INSERT ON labels
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION replicate_labels_to_tags();
```

- Delete:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER after_delete_labels
AFTER DELETE ON labels
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION delete_labels_from_tags_and_taggings();
```

- Update:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER after_update_labels
AFTER UPDATE ON labels
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_labels_to_tags();
```
